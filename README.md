# Collaborative timer
[![Go](https://github.com/keyplate/pomoteam/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/keyplate/pomoteam/actions/workflows/go.yml)

A synchronized timer for shared online focus sessions that keeps everyone on the same page.

### What makes it special?

This isn't just any timer - it synchronizes both time and controls between all participants in real-time, creating a truly collaborative focus experience.
How it works:

1) Generate a unique session link
2) Share the link with your focus partners
3) Set your intention for what you want to accomplish
4) Collectively decide on your focus session duration
5) Work together with synchronized timing and controls

Perfect for remote work teams, study groups, accountability partners, or anyone looking to boost productivity through shared focus sessions.

### History

The idea for this project came from co-working online with my friend (why? see: why? see: [Body Doubling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_doubling)). Using a timer for our sessions was productive, but inconvenient because only one of us could host it. The other person had to ask how much time was left or request session extensions. While this isn't a major issue for a single session, it becomes annoying when it happens daily. Existing solutions for this problem were unintuitive and inconvenient, which motivated the creation of this project.
